** Module project page

   Module project pages vary in depth of detail, however, because the
   content of each project page is created by one of the module's
   developers.

   *The project page is usually worth reading carefully.*

   Among other things, if the module is dependent on another module(s), or
   possibly an extra 'library'(s), that information will be posted. It is
   not critical if you forget about a module or library dependency,
   however, because later when you try to enable or use the module, you
   will get a notice about what you are missing.

*** 'Downloads' section

   A project page will always include links to get the various versions
   that are available for that module.

*** 'Issues for...':

    The module's project page will always include links under the heading
    'Issues for...'. Those links are in the right-hand column when your
    browser window is wide enough, or they are near the page bottom under
    the 'Downloads' and 'Maintainers for...' sections when your browser
    window is narrower.

    The 'Issues for...' links take you to the issues queue for that specific
    module project. The issues queue is the official place where all of the
    problems ('Bug report'), support requests, ('Support request') and
    new-feature requests ('Feature request') can be found and searched for.

    So, if you run into problems with a module, search the module's issue
    queue. If your problem (or request) has not already been addressed, post
    your question or issue using the link 'Create a new issue', and someone
    will try to help you out.

*** Resources:

    Just under the 'Issues...' section, in the section under the heading
    'Resources', I always look for the link 'Read documentation'. That link
    will not always exist, but if it is there, it is a link to what the
    project's developers consider the most useful information for their
    project.

    The 'Read documentation' link might take you to a page on drupal.org in
    the 'Documentation' section, or the link might take you to a page off of
    the drupal.org site.

    Generally speaking though, every contrib module will have a "README.txt"
    file and/or an "INSTALL.txt" file in its top-level folder that you can
    view after you download the module, or after you import it into your
    site.

    The various Documentation resources available for a module (or theme)
    are discussed elsewhere. For now, note that you can view any project's
    'README.txt' file, or see its other documentation without downloading
    anything, by following the instructions below in the 'Module
    documentation and help'

** Understand the various module versions available
   On the "project" page, see the section 'Downloads' under which are
   the sub-headings 'Recommended releases', 'Other releases', and
   'Development releases'.

   The picture below is for Drupal 7, but hopefully you get the idea.
   [[https://www.drupal.org/files/versions.png]]

   The version you choose must be compatible with the version of Drupal
   you are using. So since you are using Drupal 8, you can only use a
   'Version' that begins with '8.x-...'.

*** 'Recommended releases'

    Look for the uppermost 'Version' that you can find for
    Drupal 8. That is the version that you should try first, and
    hopefully it will be under the sub-heading 'Recommended releases',
    which means that it is stable enough to use on a live site (also
    known as a 'production' site).

*** 'Other releases'

    If no 'Recommended releases' is available, your next best option is to
    try an 'Other releases' version, if available.

    'Other releases' are generally on their way to becoming a 'Recommended
    releases' version.

    But, on the other hand, on a rare occasion an 'Other releases' version
    is an older stable version of the module before major changes were made
    to it. In that somewhat rare case, the older stable version will have
    been moved from the 'recommended releases' when the newer version was
    ready. One reason for keeping an older version around in the 'Other
    releases' section would be if some other separate module project were
    dependent on the older 'Other releases' version for that dependent
    module to work properly.

*** 'Development releases'

    The 'Development releases' version of the module is in some stage of
    development. It is the current 'state of the art of development'
    version, as the developers are working out bugs, or are adding new
    features.

    Be aware that the 'development release' might be being prepared for a
    future version of Drupal. Taking Drupal 8, for example, even though
    today Drupal 8.2 is the current recommended version of Drupal 8 core,
    the module's 'development release' might be being prepared for future
    use with the Drupal core version 8.2, or 8.3, which will have features
    not found in the current 8.1 core version.
